# πano Splash  
**Where Pi meets pitch and colors collide.**

**πano Splash** is an interactive art experiment that transforms the digits of Pi into a mesmerizing symphony of sound and color. Each digit maps to a unique musical note and bursts into vibrant visual splashes, creating a chaotic yet captivating sensory experience.
